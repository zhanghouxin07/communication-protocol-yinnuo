  //ArcLength is defined as the radius of the circle * theta, the angle between the two points along the
  //circumference

  //generally, you can find the short angle between the points given the circle's center point if you turn the
  //points on the circumference into vectors from the circle center. Using the dot product of the vectors, we
  //can determine the angle between them.
  //However, for Dubin's cars we need to know directional information, and acos() only gives us a range of
  //[0,PI] radians. Because circles for the Dubins cars are either right or left-turn only circles, we need to
  //know the angle between the two points, if we were only traveling the circle's direction (left or right).
  //Using atan2, which gives us [-PI, PI] range, we can get a positive or negative angle between our start
  //(_lhs) and goal (_rhs) points. atan2(goal) - atan2(start) will give us a positive angle if, going from
  //start to goal we must rotate through a positive angle (regardless of circle direction). Atan2 still only
  //gives us the short angle, but the directional information is useful. We can say that if the returned angle
  //to rotate through is negative (right turn) but the circle's direction is positive (left turn), we'd rather
  //have the larger angle (2PI - abs(angle_returned). Vice versa for positive angles in a right-turn circle.
